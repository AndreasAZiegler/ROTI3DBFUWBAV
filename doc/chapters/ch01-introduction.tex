\chapter{Introduction}

Object tracking is an important building block for	many interactive systems, especially for robotic systems interacting with humans. State-of-the-art robust approaches detect and recognize a small number of pre-defined	object types like humans,	birds	or cars. For	many applications tracking of arbitrary objects	is desirable, i.e. a bottle,	a hand, an animal, a face etc. Online visual tracking deals with the	challenging	task of tracking an object based on an initial bounding box in an image. This faces the fundamental problem of very limited labeled data and as a consequence any such tracking approach has to balance plasticity and drift, in particular when an object	should	be re-detected after loss of tracking. In this semester project a new approach is proposed. A fusion of ultra-wideband and visual	measurements to track an object in 3D by fusing both modalities in a principled manner.

This semester project focuses on visual tracking with correlation filters. This is typically susceptible to drift and has low accuracy in the radial direction. The aim is to compensate for this with an additional existing sensor modality based on multilateration with ultra-wideband (UWB) signals. A single tracker consists of multiple UWB units that track a single UWB unit on the target, providing a 3D position and covariance of the target. Because of the arrangement of the UWB units the tangential accuracy of the UWB position is relatively low. The visual tracker will provide a 2D measurement and a confidence. Together both observations should be fused in a principled manner using an extended Kalman filter hat will combine the strength of both approaches.
