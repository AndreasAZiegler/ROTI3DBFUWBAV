\chapter{Experiment and Results}

\section{Experiment}
To measure the accuracy of the developed system, the ROS setup similar as described in \autoref{subsec:tracking} was used. The EKF works in the camera coordinate systems with approximately $80\mathit{Hz}$. To eases the whole handling, the experiments were recorded with rosbag and then afterwards off-line evaluated with a separate python script.

To have a ground truth to compare with, the 3D coordinates of the tracked object measured by a motion capture system (VICON) were additionally recorded.

For the comparison between the accuracy of the UWB system and the one of the EKF, both systems were compared with the mentioned ground truth by the root mean squared error $$\textit{rmse} = \frac{1}{\#\text{ of elements}} \sum_i \sqrt{(x_{m,i} - x_{V,i})^2 + (y_{m,i} - y_{V,i})^2 + (z_{m,i} - z_{V,i})^2}$$
and by the root mean squared error of only the $x$ and $y$ axis
$$\textit{rmse}_{xy} = \frac{1}{\#\text{ of elements}} \sum_i \sqrt{(x_{m,i} - x_{V,i})^2 + (y_{m,i} - y_{V,i})^2}$$

where the subfix $m$ stands for measurement and represents coordinates which either come from the UWB system or from the EKF. The subfix $V$ on the other hand stands for VICON which is the ground truth in this experiment. 

\section{Results}
On several recorded experiments, the $\textit{rmse}$ and the $\textit{rmse}_{xy}$ of the EKF was significantly lower compared to the $\textit{rmse}$ and the $\textit{rmse}_{xy}$ of the UWB. The results of some experiments are listed in \autoref{tab:results}. A 3D plot of the measured coordinates by the VICON system (ground truth), the UWB system and the coordinates fused by the EKF from a data set is shown in \autoref{fig:evaluation}.
