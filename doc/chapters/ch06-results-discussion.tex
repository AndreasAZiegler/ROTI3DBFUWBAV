\chapter{Experiment and Results}

\section{Experiment}
To measure the accuracy of the developed system, a \ac{ROS} setup similar as described in \autoref{subsec:tracking} was used. The \acf{EKF} works in the camera coordinate system with approximately $80\mathit{Hz}$. To eases the whole handling, the experiments were recorded with rosbag and then afterwards off-line evaluated with a separate python script.

To have a ground truth to compare with, the 3D coordinates of the tracked object measured by a motion capture system (VICON) were additionally recorded.

For the comparison between the accuracy of the \ac{UWB} system and the one of the \ac{EKF}, both systems were compared with the mentioned ground truth by the root mean squared error $$\textit{rmse} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N - 1} \sum_i^N \big( (x_{m,i} - x_{V,i})^2 + (y_{m,i} - y_{V,i})^2 + (z_{m,i} - z_{V,i})^2}\big)$$
and by the root mean squared error of only the $x$ and $y$ axis
$$\textit{rmse}_{xy} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N - 1} \sum_i^N \big( (x_{m,i} - x_{V,i})^2 + (y_{m,i} - y_{V,i})^2}\big)$$

where the subfix $m$ stands for measurement and represents coordinates which either come from the \ac{UWB} system or from the \ac{EKF}. The subfix $V$ on the other hand stands for VICON which is the ground truth in this experiment. $N$ is, as common for $\textit{rmse}$, the number of points in the data set.

\section{Results}
On several recorded experiments, the $\textit{rmse}$ and the $\textit{rmse}_{xy}$ of the \ac{EKF} was significantly lower compared to the $\textit{rmse}$ and the $\textit{rmse}_{xy}$ of the \ac{UWB}. The results of some experiments are listed in \autoref{tab:results}. A 3D plot of the measured coordinates by the VICON system (ground truth), the \ac{UWB} system and the coordinates fused by the \ac{EKF} from a data set is shown in \autoref{fig:evaluation}.
