Copy the contents of this folder to your build directory
and execute the scripts. There are sample files for
image sequences and videos for both trackers for
Windows and Linux.

For image sequences, note Windows batch uses %
as escape character => Therefore %% are used in the scripts.
If you run the tracker directly from the command line use only
one % sign instead.

Read the scripts on the required parameters to run
the trackers on your sequences. The --help command line
argument provides a variety of available parameter
settings.
